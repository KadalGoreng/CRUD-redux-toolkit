# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## How To Run

1. In the project directory you can run:

   ### `npm start`

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

2. If your device has not installed json server, you can run:

   ### `npm install -g json-server`

3. After install json server, you can run this command in different terminal:

   ### `json-server -w db.json -p 5000`

   this command will run the database that will be use on the port [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

4. if the database is running correctly on port 5000, now you can do create, read, update, and delete in this app
